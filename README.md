# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any evidence to support a claim that being a member of the Amazon Vine program will bias the vine member to produce a more positive review of a product.

## Results

A random dataset of product reviews was pulled from AWS S3 buckets and broken down into total reviews, total 5-star reviews, 5-star reviews by Vine members, and 5-star reviews by non-members. The following is a discussion of the results:
